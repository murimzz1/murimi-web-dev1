 DAY ONE OF GITHUB WEB DEVELOPMENT
This is my first day of web design. I am a beginner who just gained interest lately and decided trying would cause no harm.

It's a 3-month programme under the SES web design department. This programme entails the following ;
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

I have downloaded various youtube courses which i believe will be a great guide in this new venture ;
